# First-Vue-Project
This repo contains the code (lectures & assessments) for the [Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (w/ Router, Vuex, Composition API)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide) 


## If you want to run attached code, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run `npm install` in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies.\
This will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment because that would bloat the ZIP file).
2. Run `npm install --save@next` to install the latest version of vuex.
3. Run `npm run serve` to bring up the development server.\
View the app at localhost:8080 (or whichever port is shown in your terminal).
